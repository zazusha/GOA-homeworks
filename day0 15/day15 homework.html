He first appeared in the 2005 video game God of War, which led to the development of eight additional titles featuring the character as the protagonist. Kratos also appears as the protagonist of the 2010 and 2018 comic series, as well as three novels retelling the events of three of the games. The character was voiced by Terrence C. Carson from 2005 to 2013,[6] with Christopher Judge taking over the role in 2018's continuation, also titled God of War. Antony Del Rio voiced a young Kratos in Ghost of Sparta.
